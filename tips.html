        <p><strong><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pressure-points-for-headaches#How-to-use-pressure-points-to-relieve-headaches">Massage</a></strong> your temples, eyebrows, or spots of pain with the tips of your fingers or knuckles</p>
        <p><strong>Cool down</strong>: change into a t-sleeve shirt or shorts, hold an ice pack to your head, or even eat a bowl of ice cream</p>
        <p><strong>Ginger</strong>: for headache-induced nausea, we recommend <a href="https://www.afoodiestaysfit.com/ginger-chews-benefits/#:~:text=Ginger%20chews%20are%20pieces%20of,mango%2C%20mandarin%20orange%20and%20lemon.">Ginger Chews</a> or Ginger Tea</p>
        <p><strong>Drink water</strong>: dehydration worsens headaches, and some medication and vitamins have dry mouth side effects</p>
        <p><strong>Eat a snack</strong> when taking medication to mitigate side effects such as nausea</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/napping/art-20048319#:~:text=Short%20naps%20generally%20don't,might%20interfere%20with%20nighttime%20sleep.">Take a nap</a></strong> if your medication causes extreme drowsiness: fighting the urge to sleep may worsen your headache</p>
        <p><strong>Unclench</strong> your jaw</p>
        <p><strong>Get some fresh air</strong> (but make sure to #MaskUp)</p>
        <p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itKtosLoGk4&list=OLAK5uy_nRAj82ywkJ_YHiRh-sXKAbpiCiUfSx0-k&index=26">Take a break!</a></strong> Look up from your page or screen every once in a while, do something mindless…</p>
        <p>And if you can, just stop working for a few hours! <strong>Prioritize your self-care and health</strong></p>
